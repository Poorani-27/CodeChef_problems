# Finding Square Roots

## Problem Description

In olden days, finding square roots seemed to be difficult, but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages. Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

## Input Format

The input consists of multiple test cases.
- The first line of the input contains an integer **T**, the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - There is a single line containing an integer **N** whose square root needs to be computed.

## Output Format

For each test case, output the square root of the input integer, rounded down to the nearest integer, in a new line.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
