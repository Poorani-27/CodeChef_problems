# Chef And Operators

## Problem Description
Chef is learning about Relational Operators. Given two numerical values A and B, you need to help chef in finding the relationship between them:
- First one is greater than the second, or
- First one is less than the second, or
- First and second one are equal.

## Input
- The first line contains an integer T, which denotes the number of test cases.
- Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B.

## Output
- For each line of input, produce one line of output containing any one of the relational operators '<', '>', or '='.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
- 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000001

## Sample Input
```
3
10 20 
20 10
10 10
```

## sample output
```
<
>
=
```

## Explanation
- In the first test case, 10 is less than 20.
- In the second test case, 20 is greater than 10.
- In the third test case, 10 is equal to 10.
