# Second Largest Number Finder

This Python program finds the second largest among three numbers.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, the total number of test cases.
Then T lines follow, each containing three integers A, B, and C separated by spaces.

## Output Format

For each test case, the program displays the second largest among A, B, and C in a new line.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 1000000
